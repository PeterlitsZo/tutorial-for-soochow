\subsection{题解}
\begin{frame} % 如果一个 frame 写不下的话，多开几个就好了～
先说结论：
\begin{itemize}
    \item 记 $x$ 表示 $n$ 二进制的位数 (除去前导 $0$)。
    \item 答案是 $2^x - 1$，($n = 1$ 的情况需要特判)。
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}

首先证明 $2^x - 1$ 是可行的，因为 $n$ 是一个 $x$ 位二进制数。

对于 $n > 1$ 有：
\begin{itemize}
    \item $1\leq 2^{x - 1}\leq n$。
    \item $1\leq 2^{x - 1} - 1\leq n$。
    \item $2^{x - 1} \oplus (2^{x - 1} - 1) = 2^x - 1$。
\end{itemize}

然后我们证明不可能得出 $\geq 2^x$ 的答案。

对于一个 $\geq 2^x$ 的答案来说，其最高位的位数一定是 $> x$ 的，而对于所有在 $[1,
n]$ 以内的数，他们 $>x$ 二进制位上的值都为 $0$，显然无法得出 $\geq 2^x$ 的答案。
