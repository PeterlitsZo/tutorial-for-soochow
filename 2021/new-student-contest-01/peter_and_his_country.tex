道理我都懂，不过为啥这个题目后面有一个数字 1 呢？

给定一个数组 $A$，第 $i$ 个元素为 $A_i$。

构造一个集合，即：\[\{x \mid A_i \in A, A_j \in A, x \mid A_i, x \mid A_j, x \le
l\}\]求该集合中的最大值。

我们知道，最大公约数能够被其他所有的公约数整除，那么如果我们求出最大公因数的所有
因数，然后二分即可得到在 $[1, l]$ 区间内的公约数。时间复杂度为 $O(\sqrt P)$。其
中分解质因数的时间复杂度是 $O(\sqrt P)$，而二分查找是 $O(\log \sqrt P)$，可以忽
略不计。

总复杂度为两两组合乘以上面的复杂度，故为 $O(n^2 \sqrt P)$。
